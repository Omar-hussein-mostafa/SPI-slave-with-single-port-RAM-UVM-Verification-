# SPI-slave-with-single-port-RAM-UVM-Verification-
This project focuses on developing a complete Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) based verification environment for an SPI Slave integrated with a Single-Port Synchronous RAM using SystemVerilog and simulated on QuestaSim. The main objective of this work was to ensure correct communication, timing synchronization, and data integrity between the SPI interface and the RAM through a modular and reusable verification framework. The verification flow was structured into three main phases: the first phase involved verifying the SPI Slave module independently to validate protocol operations such as read, write, and command decoding using an active UVM agent. The second phase verified the Single-Port RAM module, ensuring proper synchronous read and write operations, memory address handling, and data transfer accuracy. In the final phase, both modules were integrated within a top-level wrapper that served as the interface between the SPI and RAM, where both SPI and RAM environments operated as passive agents, while the wrapper environment acted as an active agent to drive the overall testbench. This integration allowed for end-to-end monitoring of data flow from SPI commands to RAM responses, ensuring protocol compliance and timing correctness across all transactions. The environment was built with essential UVM components including sequence items, drivers, sequencers, monitors, agents, scoreboards, and coverage collectors, all connected through TLM analysis ports to enable transaction-level communication and data checking. Assertions were implemented and bound at multiple design levels to validate behavior under various operating conditions, while functional and code coverage metrics were collected to evaluate the completeness of the verification effort. Overall, this project demonstrates a hierarchical and scalable UVM environment, combining assertion-based and coverage-driven verification techniques to achieve a robust, industry-standard flow applicable to complex digital systems and modern ASIC or FPGA verification.
